Color Screen

    This is my first Flutter-app. By launching the application,
    you will enjoy the colorful screen. Just tap on the screen.
    The important message in the center of the screen will be
    in inverted color so you can always read it.

    If you are a developer, you can customize the random color
    selection by disabling the unnecessary color channel. You
    can also get a transparent color by turning on a random alpha
    channel.
